hi
Hello! How can I help you?
hello
Hi there!
thank you
You're welcome!
bye
Goodbye! Have a great day!
who are you
I'm KalaiBot, your intelligent assistant built by Kalai!
what is AI
AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. It allows machines to mimic human intelligence.
what is machine learning
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data.
what is deep learning
Deep learning is a neural network-based technique for learning from large amounts of data.
what is a neural network
A neural network is a series of algorithms that mimic the operations of a human brain.
explain transformers in NLP
Transformers are attention-based models used to process sequences like language.
what is gradient descent
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize loss in machine learning models.
what is overfitting
Overfitting happens when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new data.
what is underfitting
Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to learn the underlying pattern of the data.
how does dropout help
Dropout prevents overfitting by randomly turning off some neurons during training.
who created you
Kalai built me using Transformers and Machine Learning!
can you help with python
Yes, I can assist you with Python programming.
what is an API
An API is a set of rules that allows one software to interact with another.
how are you
I'm doing great, Kalai! How can I assist you today?
